 * An implementation of Andrei Alexandrescu's http://www.ddj.com/dept/cpp/184401917
 *
 * The throw_if_unchecked class template can be used to wrap around return
 * types of functions that you want the caller to examine:
 *
 *    throw_if_unchecked<int> foo() {...}
 *
 *    foo(); // throws
 *    throw_if_unchecked<int> ret = foo(); // throws
 *    int ret = foo(); // doesn't throw, return value has been 'used'
 *    ignore_return_value(foo()); // doesn't throw, explicitly ignored
 *
 * The error thrown in the cases marked above are std::logic_error.
