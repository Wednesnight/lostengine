/**
 * The tasklet class is a simple wrapper around boost::thread that makes
 * manipulation of a thread a little easier.
 *
 * In particular, it adds several pieces of functionality over boost::thread:
 * 1) Start/stop/restart the tasklet without a need to bind a function to
 *    a boost::thread yet again. The tasklet is bound to the function to be
 *    run in a separate thread, and internally takes care of creating and
 *    tearing down boost::thread objects.
 * 2) Signal the tasklet to stop. The bound function is not interrupted, but
 *    a flag is set that the bound function can check to determine whether it
 *    should end prematurely.
 * 3) Sleep until the tasklet is stopped or some time elapsed. A common use-
 *    case for threads is to sleep most of the time, but wake up periodically
 *    to perform some task. This sleeping should be interruptible so the thread
 *    can be torn down when required. The flag & condition required to implement
 *    such functionality is abstracted out.
