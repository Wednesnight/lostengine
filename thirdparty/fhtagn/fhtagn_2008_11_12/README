The file include/fhtagn/fhtagn-config.h is normally generated by fhtagn's SCons
build. The version above is hand-written to match lostengine's assumptions.

Pretty much all of the definitions are unused in the current version of fhtagn,
with a few notable exceptions:

- HAVE_BOOST is used
- HAVE_INT64_T and HAVE_INT32_T may be used
- The version-related defines are used

Most other defines are artefacts of the build system detecting mandatory headers,
and do not result in optional compilations.
