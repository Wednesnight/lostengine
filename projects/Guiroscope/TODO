* create Window Images in VanillaFactory so Windows finally have a decent look.
* rethink image/views: should images should be replaced by views everywhere? for a button, this would mean that it could easily
  incorporate a button next to its caption, easily specifiable merely through a view => this would also mean that each 
  button state view would have to contain a caption object inside each state view that would need to be set and rendered.
* font renderer: implement caching and text rendering by rendering each character separately and rebuilding the strings
  through multiple quads => would it be feasbile to implement a quadstrip class that can more efficiently hold and render
  multiple quads at once (e.g. for string rendering) that wouldn't use glbeing/end for each quad?
